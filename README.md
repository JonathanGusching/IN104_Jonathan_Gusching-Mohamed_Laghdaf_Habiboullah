# Part one :
For the image explainability, we used a dataset of pieces of art : drawings, engravings, iconographies, and paintings. However, the available pre-trained models weren't offering a ready-to-use DL algorithm for that. So we had to code ours (using Internet sources mentioned in the comments at the beginning of cnn.py).
